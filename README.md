## Testing Responsibilities
- EdgeFieldTest.java was done by Clyde Geyer
- EdgeTableTest.java was done by Austin Clifton
- EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest.java was done by Daniel Kaszuba
- EdgeConvertFileParserTest.java was done by Callum Smathers

## Testing Details
- We've used Gradle 8.7 and JDK version 20.
- Use `gradle testBuild` to run our suite of tests. 
- There will not be a file with results, but if the build runs successfully, then all the tests have passed.
- If one or more tests fail, details will be printed to the console, and the build will fail.

## Where our code lives
- Our code lives in [this](https://github.com/CodingArctic/rit-iste422-project-team-2) GitHub repository.
