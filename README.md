## Testing Responsibilities
Clyde Geyer - EdgeFieldTest.java
Austin Clifton - EdgeTableTest.java
Daniel Kaszuba - EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest.java
Callum Smathers - EdgeConvertFileParserTest.java

## Testing Details
- We've used Gradle 8.7 and JDK version 20.
- Use `gradle testBuild` to run our suite of tests. 
- There will not be a file with results, but if the build runs successfully, then all the tests have passed.
- If one or more tests fail, details will be printed to the console, and the build will fail.

## Where our code lives
- Our code lives in [this](https://github.com/CodingArctic/rit-iste422-project-team-2) GitHub repository.
